# EPA-Emissions-with-Databricks
This project analyzes EPA emissions data across the United States and visualizes key environmental patterns using Databricks and interactive SQL dashboards. The goal is to explore emissions per county, understand geographic distribution, and identify potential correlations—such as how emissions relate to population density.
